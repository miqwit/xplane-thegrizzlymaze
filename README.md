# The Grizzly Maze

The Grizzly Maze is a mission for X-Plane users, using the plugin missionx.

## The mission

In this mission, you will help the director Werner Herzog to shoot his two last clips for his documentary **The Grizzly Maze**. You will fly the seaplane Cessna 172 with amphibious floats.

## Installation

You need to install X-Plane first, and the [MissionX plugin](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/15389-mission-x-64bit/).

Then download the zipfile and extract its content in you X-Plane directory. The content of the mission will nicely fit in your X-Plane installation :

* The mission itself (XML file) in Resources/plugins/missionx/data/
* The maps useful to achive the mission in Custom Scenery/missionx/the_grizzly_maze/

The folders and files will be created without altering other plugins or missions.
